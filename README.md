# OnlyMemes.biz

## About
OnlyMemes is a social media parody application that makes get requests to api endpoints and automatically populates comedic profiles. This is the portfolio project for Sean Taylor, Lance Burklin, and Tahlia Roper as part of the foundations curriculum at Holberton School. This project was completed over the course of 6 weeks. We decided to work together over a shared interest in making people laugh. The project delivered laughter at rates of 65% or higher.  

## Challenges
OnlyMemes was a smooth sailing project. We attribute our success to consistent communication and positive attitudes. If we had to name one challenge from this project it would be that "some divs just don't align" and that's why you've got to stay centered. 

## Installation
No installation needed! Feel free to scroll around at onlymemes.biz!
